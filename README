A superoptimizer finds a minimal program satisfying a spec. Here,
currently, minimal means shortest that runs some given examples in a
bounded time. (The example may be auto-generated from a type
declaration, QuickCheck-style.)

A brute-force first cut at doing this for the call-by-value lambda
calculus. There are smarter programs out there. There is an advantage
to this current crude approach: specifications you write can use
impure Scheme features.

Runs in Gambit Scheme. (load "loadme.scm")
